Sometimes books with poor writing style or grammar do well because the story resonates with readers. But books that sell well are books that connect with an audience. 
 Start here: write the very best book you can.

 KDP Publishing 
 My favourite thing about publishing with kdp is the highlights and notes feature. On your book&rsquo;s amazon page, you can see what sections of the book are the most highlighted and what public notes people are leaving. As a writer, this is so interesting, because it shows me what parts of</p>

              <p class="card-text">We make it easy for our authors to get their book published professionally and sold on amazon, barnes &amp; noble and other places. We understand that the self publishing process can be overwhelming. So much is involved-copyright registration, library of congress number, isbn, proofreading several times&hellip;that&rsquo;s why we have bundled the most requested services into packages. We also are mindful of the fact that authors are on a budget, therefore we offer a package that can suit most authors&rsquo; needs without breaking the bank. Once the book is published, our authors get discounted rate for printing so they can continue to earn royalties from their books. 
 A common book marketing suggestion is to set up a pre-order offer for a soon-to-be-published book or ebook.

(check your self-publishing platform for availability and details. ).
