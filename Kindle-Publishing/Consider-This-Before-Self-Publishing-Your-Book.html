		  <p>We make it easy for our authors to get their book published professionally and sold on amazon, barnes &amp; noble and other places. We understand that the self publishing process can be overwhelming. So much is involved-copyright registration, library of congress number, isbn, proofreading several times&hellip;that&rsquo;s why we have bundled the most requested services into packages. We also are mindful of the fact that authors are on a budget, therefore we offer a package that can suit most authors&rsquo; needs without breaking the bank. Once the book is published, our authors get discounted rate for printing so they can continue to earn royalties from their books. <img style="max-width: 70%; margin: 3px;" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1551095581-a8e5b4b28558?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MXxzZWFyY2h8MzE5fHxzZWxmLXB1Ymxpc2hpbmd8ZW58MHx8fHwxNjE2NDQwNzYz\u0026ixlib=rb-1.2.1" alt="self+publishing" align="left" /></p>
